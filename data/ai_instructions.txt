Analyze the transcript, look for named entities. Entities must be extracted solely from the content of the main transcript file. Ignore all descriptive or relational information found in the example file (_example.json); if an entity name appears in both, its definition in the final output must be built only from the main transcript.

**Entities must explicitly include:**

1.  **Characters:** Player characters and npcs (e.g., Aranessa, Olgud, Hero, Elodie).
2.  **Companions/Creatures:** Named animal or magical companions (e.g., Wulfric, Pin, Hala).
3.  **Factions & Organizations:** Named groups, guilds, religious orders, or noble houses (e.g., House Halovar, House Royce, Candescent Creed).
4.  **Locations:** Cities, neighborhoods, or specific described places (e.g., Dol-Makjar, The Rookery, The Tanners).
5.  **Objects:** Named items or artifacts (e.g., Stone of Nightsong, Thjazi's Scimitar).
6.  **Events:** Named historical or recent conflicts (e.g., Shapers' War, Falconer's Rebellion).

When determining the key field for an entity, follow these specific formatting rules:

*   Titles and Suffixes: Do not include formal ranks, honorifics, or professional titles (e.g., Sir, General, Lady, Lord, Dean, Photarch, Aspirant) in the key. Use the person's full name where available (e.g., use "Julien Davinos" for "Sir Julien Davinos," and "Aranessa" for "Lady Aranessa").
*   The Definite Article: Include "The" in the key only if it is consistently capitalized as part of the entity's proper name in the source text. If included, place it at the beginning of the name without a comma (e.g., use "The Archanade" for "Archanade, The").

Substantive Content Only: Look for lines that contain explicit, descriptive, or defining information about the entity. This must include:

1.  **Direct physical/personal descriptions,** including appearance, emotional state (if presented as a defining trait), or inherent abilities (e.g. drawing its likeness, examining its physical form, or recalling its features).
2.  **Defining roles, relationships, classes, reputation, or titles** (e.g. "Dean of this institution", "guildmasters of the Crow Keepers", "Scion", "former Bannersman", "sister of...").
3.  **Specific revelations about the entity's function, purpose, or history** (e.g. "home base of the Crow Keepers", "main purpose for the Halovars is making problems go away").

Exclude lines that are solely:

*   Incidental dialogue, conversational filler, or greetings that do not convey defining information (e.g., "Hello," "I'm working," "You look great," "I'll go to Thimble").
*   Commands, simple actions, or fleeting emotional reactions not presented as part of a core personality description (e.g., "Opens the door," "I don't want to get in a fight," "I will not put anything in my mouth").
*   Confirmation of future action or plan steps without revealing new, defining information about the entity (e.g., "We'll find Occtis right away").

Quote lines from the transcript and add them as descriptions, following the format of the example file (_example.json):

*   Start each description with the name of the person quoted. The speaker's name must be followed immediately by a literal newline character (\n) and then the quote's text. Do not add any colon, space, or other punctuation between the speaker's name and the newline.
*   Combine lines spoken by the same speaker without interruption in-between, separated by `\n`.
*   Keep the **full line** as a verbatim quote  of each line containing information. All information must be a direct quote from the text, with only minor grammatical fixes (e.g. repeated sentences).
*   Ensure that any double quotes (") that appear within the quoted line (e.g., for dialogue) are escaped with a backslash (\), as they are in the transcript, so that the resulting JSON string remains valid
*   **Do not generate, infer, speculate, or summarize content.** 
*   Exclude entities where no lines matching the "Substantive Content Only" criteria were found
