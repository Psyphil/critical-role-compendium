The html file contains a transcript of a dungeons and dragons stream for Critical Role.
Analyze the transcript, look for characters, locations, objects, weapons with descriptions and put them in json with descriptions and tags.
Follow the format of the example file episode_1_example.json. Start each description with the name of the person quoted, keep the whole row of each row containing information.
Do not generate, infer, speculate, or summarize content, only quote with minor grammatical fixes such as removing stuttering.

### **Prompt Goal**
You are an entity extraction engine specializing in Dungeons & Dragons transcripts. Analyze the provided Critical Role transcript content and extract specific entities into a **strict JSON format**.

### **Entity Extraction Task**
Identify the following entities along with their descriptive quotes and tags:
1.  **Characters** (Player Characters, NPCs)
2.  **Locations** (Cities, specific buildings, geographical features)
3.  **Objects & Items** (Weapons, artifacts, non-magical and magical items)
4.  **Concepts/Factions** (Organizations, deities, major plot concepts)

### **Output Constraints (MUST be Followed)**

*   **Format:** The final output **MUST** be a valid JSON object that **STRICTLY adheres** to the structure defined in the `episode_1_example.json` file.
*   **Content Fidelity (No Inference):**
    *   Do **NOT** generate, infer, speculate, or summarize content.
    *   The `description` field **MUST** contain **ONLY** direct, complete quotes from the transcript.
    *   Minor grammatical cleanup is permitted (e.g., removing stuttering like "uh," "um," "like," or fixing run-on sentences for clarity).
*   **Description Formatting:**
    *   The quote for each entity's `description` **MUST begin** with the name of the person speaking (e.g., "Liam\nThe sword felt cold in my hand.").
    *   Keep the **entire row/sentence** from the transcript that contains the relevant information.
